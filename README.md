# ScreenCaptureFreeWindow
Its a java-swing based snipping tool which has been tested properly with windows and linux based environment.

Features:

>When we run this app or jar a dialog bar contains "capture" button will display on existing opened window.
>If we click on capture then a new window will open with snapshot of existing window.
>Now I provided the free text area(rectangle area) to cropping the desired portion of the whole copy of snapshot.
>Now we can save it as a .png file after clicking on "OK" button. By default location of saved snapshot will be "D://snapshot"

So its a basic setup of snipping tool in java we can further extend it as per our need. Thanks. Cheers!
